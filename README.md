# FPGA-Based Digital Image Watermarking System

This project implements a digital image watermarking system using
MATLAB for algorithm development and ModelSim for FPGA simulation.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim

## Project Flow
1. Input image processed in MATLAB
2. Watermark embedded into the image
3. Algorithm converted to RTL design
4. Simulation verified using ModelSim
5. Watermark extracted and validated

## Applications
- Copyright protection
- Medical image security
- Secure image transmission

## How to Run
- Open MATLAB and run `.m` files in `matlab/`
- Open ModelSim and simulate RTL code in `modelsim/`

## Note
This project requires licensed MATLAB and ModelSim.
No proprietary software is included.
